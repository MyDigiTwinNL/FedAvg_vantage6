This repository includes a vantage6-compliant proof-of-concept algorithm for training a (dummy) prediction model using harmonized datasets from the MyDigiTwin project.

### Data pre-processing

This algorithms works with federated datasets (registered within a vantage6 collaboration nodes) that follow the data harmonization approach defined for the MyDigiTwin infrastructure. The algorithm requires, on each node, to pre-process the harmonized datasets with the scripts included on the `preprocessing` folder. This pre-processed CSV file is the one to be enabled on each vantage6 node. This pre-processing is performed as follows:

```bash
python sqlite_to_csv.py <harmonized_db_path> <target_harmonized_csv_file>
python data_prep.py <target_harmonized_csv_file> <target_harmonized_preprocessed_csv_file>
```

For example:
```bash
python sqlite_to_csv.py /data/path/harmonizeddataset.db.sqlite /data/path/harmonizeddataset.db.csv
python data_prep.py /data/path/harmonizeddataset.db.csv /data/path/harmonizeddataset.db.preprocessed.csv
```

### To run the algorithm test:

Install the algorithm as a local package:
`pip install -e .`

Run the test:
`python test/test_lifelines.py --fold_index 0`
